Docker Assignment1
## Overview
This project consists of two Docker containers: a server and a client. The server generates a random file, calculates its checksum, and sends it to the client. The client receives the file and verifies its checksum.

Setup and Execution
1. Run the Server:
The server will create the user-defined network, the servervol volume, and start the server to listen for client connections.

bash
Copy
Edit
./fileserver.sh
This will:

Create a user-defined Docker network (mynetwork).
Create the servervol volume.
Start the server container which listens on a port (to be specified when running the container).
2. Run the Client:
The client will connect to the server, receive the file, and verify the checksum.

bash
Copy
Edit
./fileclient.sh
This will:

Create the clientvol volume.
Start the client container, which connects to the server via the user-defined network (mynetwork).
3. Accessing Container Shells:
To manually check if the file has been received:

Access the shell of the server container:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it <server_container_id> /bin/bash
Access the shell of the client container:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it <client_container_id> /bin/bash
4. Viewing Logs:
You can view the logs of the running containers to troubleshoot or monitor their status:

For the server container:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs <server_container_id>
For the client container:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs <client_container_id>
5. File Transfer and Verification:
The server creates a random file and sends it to the client along with its checksum.
The client receives the file, saves it, and verifies the checksum.
If the checksum matches, the client prints âœ… File received successfully. Checksum verified!.
Notes:
The server listens on a port passed as a command-line argument when running the container.
The containers communicate over the user-defined network (mynetwork).
Volumes servervol and clientvol are created for persisting data between the containers.
